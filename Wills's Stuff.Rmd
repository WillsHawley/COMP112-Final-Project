```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
Spotify_Top_2017 <- read_csv("Spotify/Spotify Top 2017.csv")
Spotify_Top_2018 <- read_csv("Spotify/Spotify Top 2018.csv")

Spotify_Master<-Spotify_Top_2017 %>% 
  bind_rows(Spotify_Top_2018)
```

##### Would it be worth comparing 2017 v. 2018 songs as well for our analysis?
